Issues:
Some redundant functions
tree_node<T>::height() is of O(n) time and I would like to reduce to O(logn) of time at least
Could be more efficient overall too
No user-menu as described. Ran out of time

Notes:
I double check no mem leak. Later note: Just kidding
Ok, mem leak fixed. It was not allocating enough memory for an array
